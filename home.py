    Calculus has a lot of rules and formulas which are often presented as things to be memorized. Lots of derivative formulas, the product rule, the chain rule, implicit differentiation, the fact that integral and derivatives are opposite, Taylor series, just a lot of things like that. The goal of this website is for you to come away feeling like you could have invented calculus yourself that is cover all those core ideas.

Maybe you know that this is pi times its radius squared.

S = \pi r^2

But why? Is there a nice way to think about where this formula comes from?
Contemplating this problem and leaving yourself open to exploring the interesting thoughts that come about? 
Can actually lead you to a glimpse of three big ideas in calculus, **integrals, derivatives,
and the fact that they're opposites**.  



Let's say, with radius three, you're trying to figure out its area. Maybe you try out the idea of slicing up the circle into many concentric rings.

    Let's take one of those rings,

If we can find a nice expression for the area of each ring like this one, 
and if we have a nice way to add them all up, 
it might lead us to an understanding of the full circles area.

standard calculus notation.
